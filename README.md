# Jhool Cachie

## About

Cachie allows us to know how many times a word or a combination of words has been queried since the engine has been running. The server exposes two endpoints:

1. `POST /search` - which accepts a search query of at least a word.
2. `GET /analyse` - which accepts a comma-separated series of one or two words called the Analysis token. It returns the number of times the analysis token was found in a previous search query and the time it took to complete the analysis process.

## Setup

1. Install packages:

```
npm install
```

2. Run dev:

```
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```
npm run test
```
